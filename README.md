# Requirements Quality Impact: Prototype Study


[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/JulianFrattini/rqi-proto)](./LICENSE)

This repository contains the replication package for the prototype study that empirically investigates the impact of requirements quality defects. It is the first implementation of the requirements quality theory [1] with the goal of quantifying the impact that alleged requirements quality defects (like passive voice or ambiguous pronouns) have on subsequent software engineering activities (like domain modeling).

The study comprises of an experiment in which experiment participants were tasked to generate one domain model for each of four single sentence natural language requirements specifications. Each specification contained different requirements quality defects (passive voice and ambiguous pronouns). The experiment is used to evaluate whether these alleged quality defects have an impact on the properties of the resulting domain model. The experiment is an external, differentiated replication of a study by Femmer et al. [2].

## Structure

This repository contains the following files:

* data: folder containing all data obtained from the experiment
  * `rqi-data.csv`: data sheet aggregated from the individual data files (demographics, objects, and results) via [data-loading](./src/util/data-loading.Rmd)
  * `rqi-demographics.csv`: anonymized demographic data about the experiment participants
  * `rqi-objects.csv`: attributes of the four experimental objects (single-sentence requirements specifications)
  * `rqi-results.csv`: evaluation of the domain models produced by the experiment participants
  * `rqi-results-overlap.csv`: evaluation of a part of the domain models produced by the experiment participants, but by a different evaluator
* figures: folder containing all figures generated by the source files
* src: R code processing the data
  * bayesian: Bayesian data analyses of the following hypotheses:
    * `duration.Rmd`: "Requirements quality has an effect on the duration to create a domain model"
    * `missing-associations.Rmd`: "Requirements quality has an effect on the number of associations missing from a domain model"
    * `missing-entities.Rmd`: "Requirements quality has an effect on the number of entities missing from a domain model"
    * `superfluous-entities.Rmd`: "Requirements quality has an effect on the number of superfluous entities in a domain model"
    * `wrong-associations.Rmd`: "Requirements quality has an effect on the number of wrong associations in a domain model"
  * frequentist: Frequentist analysis of the data (investigating the hypotheses by Femmer et al. [2])
  * meta: meta-analyses assessing the validity of the research
    * `interrater-agreement.Rmd`: calculation of the inter-rater agreement of two evaluators between `rqi-results.csv` and `rqi-results-overlap.csv`
  * util: helper files for the data analysis
    * `data-loading.Rmd`: assembly of the `rqi-data.csv` sheet for analysis and initial visualization of distributions
    * `data-preparation.R`: helper method to load the `rqi-data.csv` sheet and ensure the correct column types
    * `model-eval.R`: helper method to run posterior predictions from a `brms` model
    * `setup.R`: collection of library calls for all analysis scripts
