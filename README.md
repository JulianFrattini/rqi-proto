# Requirements Quality Impact: Prototype Study


[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/JulianFrattini/rqi-proto)](./LICENSE)

This repository contains the replication package for the prototype study that empirically investigates the impact of requirements quality defects. It is the first implementation of the requirements quality theory [1] with the goal of quantifying the impact that alleged requirements quality defects (like passive voice or ambiguous pronouns) have on subsequent software engineering activities (like domain modeling).
